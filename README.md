# ta502cd
Two-channel stereo mixer, switched

## Purpose
A simple, _DJ-like_ two channel **mixer**. Inputs are intended to be taken from suitable **phono preamps** (like TuchAudio models [101b](../../../ta101b) or [103](../../../ta103)). Two _separately mixed_ outputs are provided, for both **line output** and a **headphone output** for preview.
